Essentially a fork from https://hub.docker.com/r/agrothberg/docker-woocommerce/ with some modifications to it.
At leenux we use this container specifically for testing our woocommerce integration.

This container has to be linked with a mysql container, and can be started like this:
```
docker run --name woobeat --link some-mysql:mysql -d leenux/woocommerce
```


But I'd say the best option is to start it with Docker Compose.
A docker-compose.yml like this one will do the trick:
```
webserver:
   container_name: woocommerce
   image: leenux/woocommerce
   links:
    - dbserver:mysql
   ports:
    - 8080:80

dbserver:
   container_name: woo_mariadb
   image: mariadb
   environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
   ports:
    - 3307:3306
```

By then, you'll be able to access your freshly installed wordpress on port 8080.
```
curl http://$(docker-machine ip devbox):8080
```

Have fun!
